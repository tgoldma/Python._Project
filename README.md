In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. 
I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset 
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period 
The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period 
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
